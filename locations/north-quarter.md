    Our first co-location, this shop is inside the North Quarter Market at the base of the NORA building. The market also hosts The Farmacy (a local and organic grocery store), Pop Parlour popsicles and Never Say Die Bikes (refurbished vintage road bikes). The place feels bright and energetic and makes a young neighborhood even more inviting. Open six days a week, it&#x27;s a great spot to start your day or take a lunch break.
