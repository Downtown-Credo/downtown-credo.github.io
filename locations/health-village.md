    This location opened its doors in 2015 at the invitation of Florida Hospital with the vision of becoming the neighborhood coffee shop for the burgeoning Health Village. Outlined with a 30&#x27; high wall of windows right along the Sun Rail route, it&#x27;s an inspiring place to work or meet and get things done. Open five days a week, and the mezzanine or whole space is available to rent for private events. Parking is available at two garages and we&#x27;ll validate.
