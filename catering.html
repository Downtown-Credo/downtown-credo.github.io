    somebody who&#x27;s growing coffee. Once we make a connection, we evaluate the
    growers&#x27; goals. Those goals need to include positive outcomes for the people
    and environment they directly affect. Most of our growers pick their own coffee.
    If they are hiring pickers, they need to be contributing holistically to improving
    their quality of life.'

    When crafting a food program for Downtown CREDO, embracing a plant-based approach
    felt necessary in order to align with the intentionality of CREDO&#x27;s commitment to
    examining how our daily choices impact our communities. Just as we aim to encourage
    each other to pursue lives of meaning, we strive to make menu and ingredient choices
    that have positive impacts. The growing popularity of plant-based fare comes from a
    rising social consciousness that seeks to understand the impact our food choices have
    on the environment. Offering vegan fare allows us to extend our commitment to social
    responsibility and sustainability from seed to cup, and now to plate. Whether it&#x27;s
    ethically sourced direct trade coffee or in-house made, plant-forward dishes, we aim
    to nurture people and the planet through intentional decisions.

    The best part is, regardless of dietary, religious and lifestyle choices, we&#x27;ll
    make the needed accommodations to nourish you. We are mindful of top allergens and
    cater to them with utmost care. Let us provide food and coffee for your next event,
    and you&#x27;ll see what we mean.
