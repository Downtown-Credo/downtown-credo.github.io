title: "Our Coffee"

  description: >-
    We host direct-trade coffee shops because we want to encourage folks to take small steps toward meaning and impact in community. We got into coffee philosophically, but we also love great coffee. Smart roasting is a key step in great coffee. Our roasting happens in small batches downtown in close collaboration with Coffee Roasters Alliance. You&#x27;ll always be drinking coffee at its peak freshness. Our aim is to for the roast to draw out the substantial flavors of our carefully selected beans, so you can enjoy all the flavors our growers work so hard to produce.

    <div>All of our coffee origins start with a relationship; somebody knows somebody who&#x27;s growing coffee. Once
      we make a connection, we evaluate the growers&#x27; goals. Those goals need to include positive outcomes for the
      people and environment they directly affect. Most of our growers pick their own coffee. If they are hiring
      pickers, they need to be contributing holistically to improving their quality of life.</div>
    <h4>Guatemala</h4>
    <div>This is our first origin. We met them through some friends and made our first of three trips down in the fall
      of 2010 to spend time with them. It comes from a dozen or so growers in half a dozen villages throughout the
      Ixill region of the Quiche district in the mountains of Guatemala. It&#x27;s grown at 4-5.5k ft.</div>
    <h4>Nicaragua</h4>
    <div>We&#x27;ve been working with this co-op of former Sandinista fighters in El Porvenir Nicaragua since 2012.
      They produce the coffee on their property and use the sale to help sustain their cooperative. It&#x27;s imported
      through some friends in South Carolina and we roast it here.</div>

    <h4>Mexico<br /></h4>
    <div>We met Jose through Dr. Conway at Rollins college. In 2017 Ben traveled to Chiapas to meet Jose and see the
      way is direct sale of coffee improves the quality of lives in the villages where he works. What he found was a
      collaborative effort between Rainforest Alliance, Heifer International, the Mexican government and a large
      restaurant chain to improve production and quality of life. We’re excited to support their work by buying their
      coffee. We’re aiming to become the first to bring their beautiful volcano grown coffee into the states.</div>
