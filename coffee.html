    <p>All of our coffee origins start with a relationship; somebody knows somebody who’s growing coffee. Once we make a connection, we evaluate the growers’ goals. Those goals need to include positive outcomes for the people and environment they directly affect. Most of our growers pick their own coffee. If they are hiring pickers, they contribute holistically to improving their quality of life.</p>

<h4 id="guatemala">Guatemala</h4>

<p>This was our first origin. We met them through some friends and made our first of three trips down in the fall of 2010 to spend time with them. It comes from a dozen or so Ixil farmers from Chajúl in the Quiche district of Guatemala. It’s grown in the mountains between 1300-1600 MASL. With Caturra, Bourbon, and Sarchimor varietals, this coffee is pleasantly acidic and full bodied with notes of Caramel, Chocolate, Green Apple, Watermelon.</p>

    <p>We host direct-trade coffee shops because we want to encourage folks to take
small steps toward meaning and impact in community. While we were initially
attracted to coffee philosophically, we also love pursuing and presenting
excellence in coffee. Smart roasting is a key step to presenting to you that
excellence. Our roasting happens in small batches at our facility in Ivanhoe
Village so you'll always be drinking coffee at its peak freshness. Our aim
is to craft each roast's profile to develop to perfection the aromas,
flavors, acidity and body in our carefully selected beans so you can enjoy
everything our friends at origin work so hard to produce.</p>

    <h4 id="mexico">Mexico</h4>

<p>We met José through Dr. Conway at Rollins College. In 2017, CREDO's
founder (Ben) traveled to Chiapas to meet José and see the way that direct
sale of coffee improves the quality of lives in the villages where he works.
What Ben found was a local effort between the Rainforest Alliance, Heifer
International, Toks (a Mexican restaurant chain), and the Mexican government
to collaborate with their energy and resources to improve the quality of
coffee production and the quality of life for coffee farmers. We're
excited to support their work by buying their coffee and are proud to have
been the first to bring their beautiful coffee to the states. This coffee is
grown on the slopes of Volcán Tacaná at 1400-1500 MASL. Containing a medley
of Typica, Bourbon, Marsellesa, and Costa Rica 95 varietals, we roast this
origin to highlight its notes ofBakers Chocolate, Clove, Sage, Salted
Caramel. It's our darkest roast, so if you're a traditional coffee
drinker that appreciates the bolder side of coffee, this one's for you.</p>

    <h4 id="honduras">Honduras</h4>

<p>This coffee comes to us through our friend Emil whose family runs a mill in
Honduras (mills facilitate the final preparation of coffee beans on behalf
of growers who don’t have the means to prepare it themselves). The family is
a philanthropic force in the region in solidarity with the growers they
serve. They also select coffee from organic farms to send over to us. In
your hands is one of those coffees. With your purchase you’re helping us,
and them, make an impact for good.</p>

    <h4 id="costa-rica">Costa Rica</h4>

<p>We got connected to this coffee through our friend Kieth Wittingham. He is a
business school professor with a focus on Coffee Supply Chain and had built
a strong collaboration with non-profit coffee growers. Their mission is to
pioneer methods for growing the highest quality coffee in the most
sustainable way in their region. They take the methods they learn and teach
surrounding subsistence level farmers. We’re proud to serve their coffee
and join their mission of elevating the great work of coffee growers in
Costa Rica.</p>

    <h4 id="kenya">Kenya</h4>

<p>Nate met Peter Kuria in the summer of 2021 when Peter stopped by our
roasting facility one afternoon to introduce himself. Peter's family
has been farming coffee in Nakuru Kenya since 1983, and has recently
expanded their operation into exporting their coffees to the states. Now,
they help neighboring farmers mill and sort their coffees and are working
towards helping their community gain access to better markets and higher
prices. At present, we buy two coffees from the Kuria family; their Peaberry
and part of their main crop. Comprised of SL28, Ruiru 11, Batian varietals,
these coffees are latosolic grown at 1900 MASL, wet-washed, and dried on
raised beds.</p>
