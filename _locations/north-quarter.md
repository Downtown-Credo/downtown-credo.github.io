  description: Our first co-location, this shop is in the North Quarter of
    Orlando at the base of the NORA apartment complex. We share the space with
    indie bookstore Zeppelin Books and host a rotating exhibition of local art
    curated by Artscape. In addition to coffee and tea, we now serve light bites
    and full meals from our vegan kitchen, featuring toasts, sandwiches, and
    salads as well as a brunch menu! Open six days a week, it's a great spot to
    start your day, take a lunch break, or peruse for your next favorite book.
