  description: Our first co-location, this shop is inside the North Quarter Market
    at the base of the NORA building. The market also hosts The Farmacy (a local and
    organic grocery store), Pop Parlour popsicles and Never Say Die Bikes (refurbished
    vintage road bikes). The place feels bright and energetic and makes a young neighborhood
    even more inviting. Open six days a week, it&#x27;s a great spot to start your
    day or take a lunch break.
