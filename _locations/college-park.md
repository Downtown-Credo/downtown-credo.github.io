  description: The original CREDO headquarters, this shop feels like someone dropped
    a direct-trade espresso bar into your living room or home office. First designed
    by Stephan Monteserin to be a comfortable space to join CREDO&#x27;s movement,
    the space has slowly evolved over the years but maintained the same ethic. It&#x27;s
    our only location open 7days a week, there&#x27;s an intimate back room available
    for private meetings, and the whole space can be rented out in the evenings.
