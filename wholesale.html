  description: All of our coffee origins start with a relationship; somebody knows
    somebody who&#x27;s growing coffee. Once we make a connection, we evaluate the
    growers&#x27; goals. Those goals need to include positive outcomes for the people
    and environment they directly affect. Most of our growers pick their own coffee.
    If they are hiring pickers, they need to be contributing holistically to improving
    their quality of life.
